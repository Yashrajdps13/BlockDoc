# BlockDoc - Revolutionizing Healthcare with Blockchain and ML

BlockDoc is an innovative project that combines the power of Blockchain and Machine Learning (ML) to decentralize the process of storing patients' medical reports. With a user-friendly frontend developed in both Flutter and Web technologies, BlockDoc not only enables secure storage but also facilitates predictive diagnosis for various diseases.

## Project Overview

BlockDoc aims to empower patients by providing a decentralized solution for storing and managing medical reports on the blockchain. The integration of ML models allows users to input their medical details, and our algorithms predict potential health issues, including liver disease, heart disease, kidney problems, pneumonia, malaria, diabetes, and breast cancer.

## Features

- **Medical Report Storage**: Decentralized storage of patients' medical reports on the blockchain.
- **Predictive Diagnosis**: ML models for predicting diseases based on user-entered medical details.
- **Frontend Platforms**: User-friendly interfaces developed in Flutter and Web for accessibility.
- **PDF Summarizer**: ML model-driven summarizer for extracting valuable insights from medical report PDFs.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: HardHat, Polygon, ReactJS, EtherJS
- **Machine Learning**: Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Flask,Pillow,Numpy
- **Frontend (Flutter)**: Dart, Flutter
- **Frontend (Web)**: HTML,CSS,JavaScript,TypeScript,NextJS,TailwindCSS
- **PDF Summarizer**: NLTK(NLP), PalmAPI,Transformers,Streamlit
